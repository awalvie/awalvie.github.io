will have
essential things that I wish to possess in the future
20200614

<p>The purpose of the document is personal in nature. I don't like buying things unless I'm getting rid of something at the same time, or unless it's essential. The less things I have the more I can concentrate on using and being creative with them. Intent and the drive to act, is more important than possessing the best tools. It's the artist who makes art, not the brush. Here are some of the things I feel would help me in future endeavors.</p>


<ul class='single'>
<li><b>camera</b>: Canon EOS M50</li>
<p>We used to own a camera in the family some 10-11 years ago, an old beast of a Canon. We don't take a lot of photos and have never needed more than the mobile camera for the casual photo. Since last year, I've really wanted to go hiking for a while now and I want to be able to preserve the experiences I have in a higher quality than what the mobile would offer.</p>

<li><b>Trekking Gear</b>: Shoes, Bag, Trekking Pole, Trekking Clothing etc.</li>
<p>As mentioned above I have been inspired to trek and experience nature solely due to <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/KadamsMedia'>Kraig Adam's YouTube Channel</a>. I've always lived my life indoors and never have experienced the nature for what it truly is. I plan on doing so in the future.</p>

<li><b>Keyboard:</b> Anne Pro</li>
<p>I have been using the Logitech K480 on and off during lockdown and I enjoy having a bluetooth keyboard. It's keys though are awful and it's layout worse. The Anne Pro was recommended to me by a friend and it seems to check all the boxes</p>

<li><b>Headphones:</b> Audio Technica ATX M50BT</li>
<p>I'm a fan of Audio Technica, my current M20 has lasted me for the past 5 years, still being rock soild when it comes to audio. I would love to upgrade to the M50 when it dies.</p>

<li><b>Swiss Army Knife</b></li>
<p>It's a practically designed tool that is useful whatever you are doing.</p>
