<p>I feel myself driven towards an end that I do not know.  As soon as I have reached it, as soon as I shall become unnecessary, an atom will suffice to shatter me. Until then, all the forces of mankind can do nothing to stop me. </p>
<p>- Napoleon</p>

<p>There is no such thing as talent. There is only a history of one's self that is so easily forgotten. A history full of experiences - or a history devoid of them. A history of exposure to some things over others. So relax. You're not special. You're not uniquely ungifted. You're just showing up to a jousting match armed with a bow and arrow, and don't yet fully understand the difference. But you will, if you're willing to get knocked down to the ground over and over again. You're allowed to feel down on yourself, and you're allowed to cry over your scrapes. Just don't forget: rather than talent, it is another t-word that makes a master. Tenacity.</p>
