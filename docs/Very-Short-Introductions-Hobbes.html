<blockquote>
<p>For such is the nature of man, that howsoever they may acknowledge many others to be more witty, or more eloquent, or more learned; Yet they will hardly believe there be many so wise as themselves: For they see their own wit at hand, and other mens at a distance.</p>

<p>Hobbes: A Very Short Introduction by Richard Tuck belongs to a catalog of books published by the Oxford University Press. As the name implies these books are a short introduction to ideas, individuals among many other things.</p>
<p>Thomas Hobbes was a 17th century English philosopher who is chiefly remembered for <strong>Leviathan</strong> which is the definitive and judicious argument for why the people should obey government authority even of a very imperfect and brutal kind. He wrote extensively about politics, human nature, science and had a prolific impact on modern philosophy. This book is divided into 3 sections which talk about his life, his work and it’s subsequent interpretation by his peers and the future generations.</p>
<p>This was my first book related to Philosophy, specifically Political Philosophy, a branch that I never knew existed. I went into it half-expecting to be bored because of my apprehension about anything related to politics. I was mesmerized. I would recommend that if you solely want to read about Hobbes and his work, you should consider skipping the first chapter as it’s mostly a biography of his life.</p>
<p>I was at a loss for words when the teacher (who recommended the book to me) asked me what I thought about the book. It was a very new and foreign experience for me. A very important lesson I’ve learned is the importance of reading slowly. You’re not supposed to rush to the end. People like Hobbes were some of the greatest thinkers in history. They condensed their infinite wisdom into a 400 page volume of paper. Every word, every sentence is exactly where it’s supposed to be. The least you could do is concentrate and pay attention to understand their propositions and arguments to problems that have plagued humanity from time immemorial.</p>

0%, I simply read it as an exercise in understanding and interpreting the text fully.</p>

ying at his mother’s funeral. Society cannot accept that sometimes, things happen out of chance, coincidences, and random occurrences. For the harmony of it’s core beliefs everything has to have a moral, ethical, and logical explanation. Both the defense and the prosecution tries to attribute an explanation to his irrational behavior. They both – and we can argue, society together – try to manufacture rational order. His actions challenge their core beliefs of living, and as such he poses a threat to them, so he is sentenced to be executed.</p>
<p>Following the verdict, we see the Mersault grappling with the notion of his life coming to an end. He wants to live longer and walk the streets, like a free man again. Interestingly enough, he only comes to the conclusion that the authorities are punishing him by taking away his freedom after the jailer explains it to him. He hopes that his appeal will come through and he’ll get to live for a little longer. But you see the epiphony that he comes to after the conversation with the priest.</p>
<p>The priest is absolutely sure that any man, in Mersault’s situation, no matter his beliefs, will turn and look for solace and comfort in religion. Sure you can play the atheist when you have time to play fidget with the idea of their being no God, but surely in Mersault’s case, he would eventually look for the divine. Mersault answers the question in the following way,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you no hope at all? And do you really live with the thought that when you die, you die, and nothing remains?" “Yes,” I said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His conversation leads to him finally coming to terms with this execution. He believes in nothing, that it was all absurd, so why care if your die after 30 years or in 5 days, death is inevitable and is the only logical conclusion to the absurdity of existence, be happy for the time you have left and live in the present. What follows is the final dialogue by Mersault,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I’d been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a short read and I would highly recommend that you take the time to read it.</p>
