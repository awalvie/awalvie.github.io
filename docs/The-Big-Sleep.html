<p>It was about eleven o’clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark little clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I didn’t care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars.</p>
<p>– Philip Marlowe</p>

<p>The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler is noir at it’s finest. It’s the first book (out of seven) with Chandler’s protagonist Philip Marlowe, a gentleman sleuth with a code of honor. It oozes with style, finesse, and sophistication. I didn’t like the plot and mostly used it as reading exercise.</p>
<p>Philip Marlowe a cynical and tough detective is contacted by the old and ailing General Sternwood to help him “take care of” someone who’s been blackmailing him. The plot thickens with murder, conspiracy, and cover-ups as Marlowe tries to untangle this web of deception.</p>
<p>Raymond Chandler like Tolkien was a pioneer, even definer of his genre. His works, writing style, and plots have become synonymous with the genre itself. Maybe that’s why I did not have a great time reading the book.</p>
<p>Unlike Tolkien’s fantasy, I’ve listened to, read or seen hundreds, maybe even thousands of noir and detective stories. I’ve gotten used to, even bored by the interchangeable plot. The plot twists are predictable and not exciting, the revelations expected and not exhilarating and the style and poise stereotypical cliche.</p>
<p>I think it’s my own fault that I did not like this book. I’ve gotten too tired of these stories to properly enjoy them. Chandler’s influence over noir is evident from the previous statement. His work was so essential in the construction and shaping of the genre that everyone who followed fundamentally inherited his style and integrated it into their own, which makes it harder for newer readers to appreciate his work. The writing style is dense with metaphors and the lexicon enormous. I’ve been trying hard to understand the symbology that authors employ and hide under the guise of sentences and that was one of the reasons I did not drop the book. After the first 30%, I simply read it as an exercise in understanding and interpreting the text fully.</p>

ying at his mother’s funeral. Society cannot accept that sometimes, things happen out of chance, coincidences, and random occurrences. For the harmony of it’s core beliefs everything has to have a moral, ethical, and logical explanation. Both the defense and the prosecution tries to attribute an explanation to his irrational behavior. They both – and we can argue, society together – try to manufacture rational order. His actions challenge their core beliefs of living, and as such he poses a threat to them, so he is sentenced to be executed.</p>
<p>Following the verdict, we see the Mersault grappling with the notion of his life coming to an end. He wants to live longer and walk the streets, like a free man again. Interestingly enough, he only comes to the conclusion that the authorities are punishing him by taking away his freedom after the jailer explains it to him. He hopes that his appeal will come through and he’ll get to live for a little longer. But you see the epiphony that he comes to after the conversation with the priest.</p>
<p>The priest is absolutely sure that any man, in Mersault’s situation, no matter his beliefs, will turn and look for solace and comfort in religion. Sure you can play the atheist when you have time to play fidget with the idea of their being no God, but surely in Mersault’s case, he would eventually look for the divine. Mersault answers the question in the following way,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you no hope at all? And do you really live with the thought that when you die, you die, and nothing remains?" “Yes,” I said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His conversation leads to him finally coming to terms with this execution. He believes in nothing, that it was all absurd, so why care if your die after 30 years or in 5 days, death is inevitable and is the only logical conclusion to the absurdity of existence, be happy for the time you have left and live in the present. What follows is the final dialogue by Mersault,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I’d been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a short read and I would highly recommend that you take the time to read it.</p>
