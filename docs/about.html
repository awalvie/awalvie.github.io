<p>hi, I’m awalvie, also known as vishesh in the real world and welcome to my little corner on the
    internet. I am starting this website as a way of motivating myself into making meaningful
    contributions to open source software, improve my writing skills (which you will be noticing
    throughout the blog are completely garbage) and being more accountable.</p>
<p>my weekends start with a nice</p>
<pre><code>mkdir super_awesome_project</code></pre>
<p>and end with</p>
<pre><code>rm -rf ./super_awesome_project</code></pre>
<p>The social skills I lack (as pointed out by my parents), I like to think I make up for by having a
    high amount of curiosity, love for computers and addiction to coffee. I am always interested in
    talking to people to share ideas and solve problems, feel free to shoot a DM or email if you want to
    reach out.</p>
<p>I also like reading books and will be writing about them, these won’t be reviews but just my thoughts
    put on paper.</p>

</ul>al (except having an extra limb and a second head). They question reality and accepted beliefs and demonstrate their fragility frequently.</p>
<p>I got out of this book exactly what I was looking for, a fun, carefree read, filled with laughter and joy. My only regret is that I didn’t have a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster while I was reading it.</p>

<p>For me, the book did not do more than expanding on existing beliefs and held truths. Most of what the book preaches I have identified and have actively tried to do in the past but haven’t been successful. It helped me feel worse about the things I’ve done over the last 5 years and nothing else.</p>
<p>I don’t think the book is bad inherently, in fact, it’s a great book if you actually can put into practice what Cal proposes, just not for me.</p>
