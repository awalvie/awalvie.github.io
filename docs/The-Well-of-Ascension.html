<p>The book meandered a little too much for my taste. Lot’s of fantastic character development, but personally I didn’t really find myself esctatic after finishing the book. I’ve concluded that fantasy is definitely not the genre for me. The only fantasy series that I see myself picking up in the future would be the <strong>First Law</strong> series because it’s part fantasy part grim dark.</p>

’s nothing that hasn’t been resolved but still, I feel like there was something missing. I still like the ending itself but the book as a whole was underwhelming.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>I started reading the books simply because the Netflix TV Show was about to air and I wanted to get back into reading as mentioned in the first book’s post, but in all I had an absolute blast reading all the books, I spent 23 hours reading the last two books in 3 days, that should give you an idea of how much I was invested in the books and how much I cared for the story, books to me are very special, something that I’ve recently come to realize, I wasn’t able to write great summaries about the books and I feel like I do a disservice to the books because of it, don’t let my criticism turn you away from the books, it’s a fantastic fantasy series and would highly recommend it.</p>

oks which touched on very heavy themes, the book is anything but that. The rules in the book when at face value are so simple and self-evident that you might feel offended by them being stated to you. You implicitly know and understand all of them, you might even feel denigrated. It’s precisely why the book is important.</p>
<p>Often times in childhood you are told ludicrous stories and reasons to believe in ideas and dogma (especially if you are from where I’m from). Being a child you are naturally curious, you mercilessly question your parents, <strong>Why</strong>, but your thirst for an answer is rarely satiated. After a while you start accepting things as they are told to you, because it’s too much effort to really understand <strong>why</strong>. You forget about them as you grow older because the chaos of everyday life consumes and drains you, and you are shaped in the way your surroundings and society shape you. Especially today.</p>
<p>Fixing this problem is where this book, excels. At the start of each chapter, the Rule is stated in the heading. It helps that the Rules are clear and concise. What follows, in sub-headings, is a journey back to the Rule. Jordan makes use of philosophy, theology, psychology and a plethora of other fields to explore the rule. He frequently uses Biblical stories and personal experiences to draw a narrative that helps us understand how these Rules might help us sort out our lives. It’s like a puzzle that you forgot about a long time ago. You knew what the final photo looked like, but you didn’t have the pieces to put it together, and that’s exactly what Jordan provides you with here. Because it makes sense, you retain it for longer and hopefully put your newfound knowledge to good use.</p>
<p>Overall, I’d say the reading experience for this book is highly subjective. Whether you like the book or not depends highly on your own personal beliefs, values, experiences and morals. If you do decide to read the book, just keep an open mind. I, had a great time with it and will be re-reading this in the future. There’s a wealth of knowledge here, some of which I understood and some that I simply read. I think another careful examination of the book may yet provide me with valuable insight about my own life and struggles, and how I can work towards resolving them.</p>

 absurd, so why care if your die after 30 years or in 5 days, death is inevitable and is the only logical conclusion to the absurdity of existence, be happy for the time you have left and live in the present. What follows is the final dialogue by Mersault,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I’d been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a short read and I would highly recommend that you take the time to read it.</p>
