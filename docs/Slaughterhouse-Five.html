<p>Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5 also known by it’s underappreciated alternate name <em>The Children’s Crusade</em> is an anti-war book. It was written in 1969 during the Vietnam War but it talks about the World War II, the air-raid on Dresden and it’s tragedy. We follow Billy Pilgrim who as he describes it, has come <em>unstuck in time</em> which causes him to jump between his past, present and future self. Also he gets captured by aliens.</p>
<p>John Green in his Crash Course Literature Videos <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> talks at length about the book, and it’s through these that I was able to better understand the book.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t really have a lot of thoughts about the book. I read the work casually and did not give it the attention it required of me.</p>
<p>I will read this book again, once I have seen more of life, read more books and lived a little, maybe then I’ll come to appreciate all the subtleties and nuances of Vonnegut’s work.</p>

nymore, but they are lost in their effect on people because they have no reason to believe or trust in them and it’s books and stories like these that reinforce why we ought to. It’s a tale of human resilience, camaraderie, survival and hope, in the bleakest of situations.</p>
<p>This is absolutely one of the best books I’ve ever read.</p>

rt to really understand <strong>why</strong>. You forget about them as you grow older because the chaos of everyday life consumes and drains you, and you are shaped in the way your surroundings and society shape you. Especially today.</p>
<p>Fixing this problem is where this book, excels. At the start of each chapter, the Rule is stated in the heading. It helps that the Rules are clear and concise. What follows, in sub-headings, is a journey back to the Rule. Jordan makes use of philosophy, theology, psychology and a plethora of other fields to explore the rule. He frequently uses Biblical stories and personal experiences to draw a narrative that helps us understand how these Rules might help us sort out our lives. It’s like a puzzle that you forgot about a long time ago. You knew what the final photo looked like, but you didn’t have the pieces to put it together, and that’s exactly what Jordan provides you with here. Because it makes sense, you retain it for longer and hopefully put your newfound knowledge to good use.</p>
<p>Overall, I’d say the reading experience for this book is highly subjective. Whether you like the book or not depends highly on your own personal beliefs, values, experiences and morals. If you do decide to read the book, just keep an open mind. I, had a great time with it and will be re-reading this in the future. There’s a wealth of knowledge here, some of which I understood and some that I simply read. I think another careful examination of the book may yet provide me with valuable insight about my own life and struggles, and how I can work towards resolving them.</p>

 absurd, so why care if your die after 30 years or in 5 days, death is inevitable and is the only logical conclusion to the absurdity of existence, be happy for the time you have left and live in the present. What follows is the final dialogue by Mersault,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I’d been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a short read and I would highly recommend that you take the time to read it.</p>
