<p>Not a whole lot to say about these books without spoiling them, but another great entry.</p>
<p>I guess that would be incorrect or better put, dishonest, as much as I am engrossed in the books while reading them, I don’t really recall a whole lot of things that really stuck in my mind after reading this, though the adventures are fantastic the myths, legendary and the fights brutal and savage the plot as much as I like it remains very predictable, maybe it’s because I’ve played the 3rd Game that I know what’s coming but it all feels very linear and tiring. I did very much like Ciri’s arc throughout the book, realizing and accepting who she is and ultimately redeeming herself. The journey of Geralt and his company was frankly underwhelming, it just existed for the sake of having Geralt go and kill some people in my opinion. In all fairness, a decent book for the saga, not too good, not too bad, or as master Dunkey would say,</p>

<p>I was terrified while reading the book. Scared, trying to visualize the society that Orwell had painted and mesmerized by the depth and detail with which he had expressed his world. Ideas are not simply presented to the reader, but explored microscopically. His vision of this future might sound absurd simply because it’s hard to comprehend <strong>living</strong> in, which speaks volumes as to why we should avoid it. I will be re-reading this book every year, to grasp and have a better understanding of the text, there’s too much in here to ruminate about.</p>
<p>Orwell’s magnum opus is an incredible meditation on society, power, historical negationism and propaganda. It’s as important today as it was when it was written, maybe more.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, try and find the time to read this masterpiece.</p>

oral or rational meaning. The expectancy of a rational world when consistently faced with the reality of our irrational world seems absurd. He believed that human life is an irrational, absurd, and illogical death sentence.</p>
<p>The plague descended on a town of people who were happy in the comfort of their habits and oblivious to how lucky there were. The plague is a grotesque illness, excruciatingly painful, usually marking its victims for death, quarantining, and often infecting their families. Extreme, senseless unreasonable suffering, not only of the patients and their families but of the terrified residents, the duty-driven doctors, the town administration, about their bleak futures.</p>
<p>Throughout the book we see the population evolve. In the first days of the plague, everyone regarded their own personal suffering as unique and are indifferent to the common suffering. But as the memories of the past fade and time wears them down, they begin to share in the collective suffering. More people, start joining and helping in the anti-plague effort. And we see the fragmented town start to come together and resist the plague. As futile as their efforts are, this, according to Camus is the only way to live. A noble, meaningful struggle even when faced with never-ending defeat. The only way to live is to fight on.</p>

<p>I think I do a terrible injustice to the book summarizing it this way, this summary comes not only from my own reading of the book but also from various articles and other summaries of the book online. There are other things that I would have liked to mention, concerning the theology in the book, symbology, and perhaps extrapolate Camus’ philosophical thoughts better, but I’m not articulate enough at the moment to pen them down right now. Camus stands as one of my favorite authors after this and his next book, right next to Orwell. It’s a brilliant book, dark, yes, but ultimately hopeful.</p>
