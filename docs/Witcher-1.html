<p>You can’t stop a soldier from being frightened but you can give him motivation to help him overcome that fear. I have no such motivation. I can’t have. I’m a witcher: an artificially created mutant. I kill monsters for money. I defend children when their parents pay me to. If Nilfgaardian parents pay me, I’ll defend Nilfgaardian children. And even if the world lies in ruin - which does not seem likely to me - I’ll carry on killing monsters in the ruins of this world until some monster kills me. That is my fate, my reason, my life and my attitude to the world. And it is not what I chose. It was chosen for me.</p>
<p>– Geralt</p>

<p>I was trying to get rid of my YouTube addiction when I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw--xPGVVxYzRsWyV1nFqgg">this guy’s</a> channel, his genuine sincerity and love for the genre coupled with the Witcher TV adaptation coming out soon, I decided to start reading the books. This is my first fantasy series and it’s been pretty fun,</p>
<p>I wasn’t really expecting anything, but I had a great time with this book, I was familiar with the characters already since I’d played Witcher 3 which helped greatly while reading, that is also part of the reason why I did not read the fist two books which are just short stories that introduce the cast of characters and how they are related to each other.</p>
<p>The book, is good, all the characters have very distinct personalities and are very likable, you aren’t really given a lot of character development because that is the main focus with the first two books, and you just get going with the plot, the plot has a <strong>Chosen One</strong> (which I’m not really a fan of) but it’s handeled really well. The story unfolds against the backdrop of a world torn by war. The world building felt authentic and gave a lot of justification to the motivations of our characters. The book does slow down, especially when Geralt is not in the picture but all in all I had a great time with the book and would recommend it to others.</p>

well’s magnum opus is an incredible meditation on society, power, historical negationism and propaganda. It’s as important today as it was when it was written, maybe more.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, try and find the time to read this masterpiece.</p>

oral or rational meaning. The expectancy of a rational world when consistently faced with the reality of our irrational world seems absurd. He believed that human life is an irrational, absurd, and illogical death sentence.</p>
<p>The plague descended on a town of people who were happy in the comfort of their habits and oblivious to how lucky there were. The plague is a grotesque illness, excruciatingly painful, usually marking its victims for death, quarantining, and often infecting their families. Extreme, senseless unreasonable suffering, not only of the patients and their families but of the terrified residents, the duty-driven doctors, the town administration, about their bleak futures.</p>
<p>Throughout the book we see the population evolve. In the first days of the plague, everyone regarded their own personal suffering as unique and are indifferent to the common suffering. But as the memories of the past fade and time wears them down, they begin to share in the collective suffering. More people, start joining and helping in the anti-plague effort. And we see the fragmented town start to come together and resist the plague. As futile as their efforts are, this, according to Camus is the only way to live. A noble, meaningful struggle even when faced with never-ending defeat. The only way to live is to fight on.</p>

<p>I have no idea what’s awaiting me, or what will happen when this all ends. For the moment I know this: there are sick people and they need curing.</p>

<p>I think I do a terrible injustice to the book summarizing it this way, this summary comes not only from my own reading of the book but also from various articles and other summaries of the book online. There are other things that I would have liked to mention, concerning the theology in the book, symbology, and perhaps extrapolate Camus’ philosophical thoughts better, but I’m not articulate enough at the moment to pen them down right now. Camus stands as one of my favorite authors after this and his next book, right next to Orwell. It’s a brilliant book, dark, yes, but ultimately hopeful.</p>
