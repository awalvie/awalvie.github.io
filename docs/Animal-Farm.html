<p>All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.</p>
<p>George Orwell, Animal Farm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before reading this book I highly recommend that you read <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/the-freedom-of-the-press/">this</a> and <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/books-by-orwell/animal-farm/preface-to-the-ukrainian-edition-of-animal-farm-by-george-orwell/">this</a>. This will provide you with the necessary context for what’s being talked about in the book.</p>
<p>Captioned <strong>A fairy story</strong> this book is anything but that, antagonized by the humans the animals of Manor Farm revolt and succeed in breaking their chains of enslavement. They agree to abide by the seven commandments that they create with the highest principle being “All animals are equal” but as the story progresses, we see that after all that might not be the case…</p>
<p>Animal Farm is an allegory meant to talk about the Russian Revolution of the 20th Century, in its simplicity Orwell elegantly talks about how the struggle for revolution can morph into a fight for power and how twisted the original ideals become to suit the needs of the current ruler.</p>
<p>It’s a very short book that you can get through in a day and a timeless classic.</p>

ld, so certain that no reasonable man can doubt it?</p>

<p>Russell begins by questioning common certainties. Questions such as the existence of a table in front of him. He describes the way we gather the knowledge of the existence of the table, using our senses and then using the Descartes method of cartesian doubt goes on to prove that the table indeed can’t exist. This is what really drew me in, this change in the way of looking at things, the freedom that logic gives you. Then, the journey begins, we keep questioning things in a journey to theorize how we gain knowledge. We begin from metaphysics and then connect it to epistemology in an attempt to understand matter, reality and existence and so much more.</p>
<p>The meaning of words is of quintessential importance to the philosopher. Accurately understanding the meaning of the word in the given context helps us prove/disprove our or others’ logic and arguments when trying to explain a subject matter or theorizing.</p>
<p>Russell possesses an encyclopedic amount of knowledge about western philosophy and it’s amazing the way in which he is able to break this information down into bite-size digestible pieces using examples that help to grasp the crux of what he is trying to make us understand.</p>
<p>The book also is a survey of the ideas of important thinkers historically. We are introduced to Berkley, Leibniz, Descartes, Kant, Plato and then some. The book hence serves as a good overview of the major figures in the philosophical world.</p>
<p>Problems of Philosophy is a difficult book to summarize. This is the first primary text I’ve read and I was shellshocked and tired by the end. It was a very tedious read. I had to jot down notes every couple of pages (which I did for the first 5 Chapter) and really think through what he was trying to say. But it was an incredibly satisfying read and I am very happy that I pushed through and finished the book. I don’t think I understood a lot of what was explained in the book, I think it would be presumptuous and for me to think I can. I look forward to re-reading the text in the future.</p>

now this: there are sick people and they need curing.</p>

<p>I think I do a terrible injustice to the book summarizing it this way, this summary comes not only from my own reading of the book but also from various articles and other summaries of the book online. There are other things that I would have liked to mention, concerning the theology in the book, symbology, and perhaps extrapolate Camus’ philosophical thoughts better, but I’m not articulate enough at the moment to pen them down right now. Camus stands as one of my favorite authors after this and his next book, right next to Orwell. It’s a brilliant book, dark, yes, but ultimately hopeful.</p>
